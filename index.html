</li>
</ul>

<h1>Manifesto</h1>
<p>
This is a draft and will be refined over time.
</p>
<p>
If there is one ultimate objective of this project it is to: disintermediate the media from politics. Simply: to reduce the political power of the media itself in political discourse and return that power to people by suggesting ways to apply the ancient technique of dialectic to the analysis of political rhetoric and to do so in a way that maximises the participation of people from all walks of life, irrespective of ideology, literacy and educational qualifications. These ideas will only become real if other people implement them. Find an idea you like, then find a way to contribute to its implementation.
</p>
<p>
The manifesto is intended to be as ideologically neutral as possible.
</p>
<p>
Be sceptical of any any claims made by or about this manifesto, especially claims made by others. Test all such claims yourself. Think.

<h1>Twitter</h1>
<h2>Relationship of project to twitter.com</h2>
<p>This project has no relationship to the twitter.com, the owner of the Twitter platform itself. In what is meant to be a gesture of good faith, if the owners of Twitter trademark would like me to transfer control of domains containing the letters "twitter" to Twitter, I promise to do so. However, in the interests of fairness I would appreciate the opportunity to engage the executive of Twitter in dialog before any legal demand is issued. The objective to ensure that we can achieve a mutually acceptable outcome with a minimum of fuss. This offer does not extend to domain names that do not contain the letters 'twitter' unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h2>Twitter account</h2>
<p>The primary twitter account used by this project is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tweeterzen">@tweeterzen</a>. Tweets from this account are intended to be ideologically neutral and as consistent with the manifesto as possible.</p>
<p>The founder also uses his own account <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/@jonseymour">@jonseymour</a> for personal purpose or for debates in which he wishes to adopt his own, partisan, position.</p>

<!-- This section will document my own political history  -->
While at school in the early 1980s, I guess I reflected my parents opinions and supported the Liberal Party. I started towards Labor while still at school at a time when the nation had decided to give Bob Hawke a run. While at university, I started leaning towards the Australian Democrats partly because I recognised the value of a moderating force in the Senate. I liked Paul Keating. I was mortified when John Howard came to power in 1996 but didn't migrate to card carrying Howard Hater until the small detailts of Children Overboard, TAMPA, Iraq War, AWB. As the Australian Democrats dissolved, I started to move my allegiance towards the Greens. In my view, they are the least cynical of all the political parties operating in the Australian system. They tell you exactly what they want, usually don't get it but say a polite thank you when they do. Can't argue with that.
